            <AccordionHeader>What is Smilebooth360 ?</AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionBody>
            The Smile bit is ours ðŸ˜‰ but the 360 booth records high-quality video of your guests for several seconds while the camera revolves around them at a high framerate. The captured footage is then processed into a video that allows you to control the speed, selectively speeding up and slowing down certain parts. Additionally, the app offers the option to superimpose a static overlay of your choice, such as a logo, monogram, or any desired image.
